Inflow Inventory Manual Testing Project

This repository contains my manual testing project for the Inflow Inventory management system. The primary objective was to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system across several critical modules, each of which plays a crucial role in inventory management. The testing focused on functional validation, usability, and data integrity within each module.
